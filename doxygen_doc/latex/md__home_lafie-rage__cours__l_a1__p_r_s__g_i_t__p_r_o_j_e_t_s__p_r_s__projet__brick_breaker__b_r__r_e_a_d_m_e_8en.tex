\subsection*{Introduction}

A highschool project during our third year in information technology school.

The goal was to make a multiplayer game and also make it as simple as possible to use in order to let anyone downloading it and enjoying playing or coding.

This game will {\bfseries only run on linux} at the moment. Feel free to help us if you want to make it runnable on any other OS.

A french version of this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME is avaiblabe \hyperlink{_r_e_a_d_m_e_8fr_8md}{here}. This one is more detailed because we\textquotesingle{}re a french team and the goal was to make a documentation for french people.
