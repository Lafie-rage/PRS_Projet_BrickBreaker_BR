## Introduction

A highschool project during our third year in information technology school.


The goal was to make a multiplayer game and also make it as simple as possible to use in order to let anyone downloading it and enjoying playing or coding.

This game will **only run on linux** at the moment.  
Feel free to help us if you want to make it runnable on any other OS.

A french version of this README is avaiblabe [here](README.fr.md).

You can now simply download the zip archive by clicking on "**Code**" then "**Download ZIP**".  
You will only have to extract the files from the archive where you want the game to be.

To run the game, check out the "__Build game__" section.

### Getting the source to play and help in the development
