## Introduction

A highschool project during our third year in information technology school.


The goal was to make a multiplayer game and also make it as simple as possible to use in order to let anyone downloading it and enjoying playing or coding.

This game will **only run on linux** at the moment.  
Feel free to help us if you want to make it runnable on any other OS.

A french version of this README is avaiblabe [here](README.fr.md).
This one is more detailed because we're a french team and the goal was to make a documentation for french people.
